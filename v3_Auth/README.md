# Envoy-Auth-gRPC-v3

## V3 of the auth service API used for Ambassador Edge Stack has been released as part of Emissary-ingress/Edge-Stack version `2.3.0`. Version `2.3.0` supports both the `v2` and the `v3` API, whereas as of Emissary-ingress/Edge-Stack version `3.0.0` only the `v3` transport protocol is supported.

## Please see the v2 service if you are looking for an example you can use for Emissary-ingress/Edge-Stack versions prior to `2.3.0`.
